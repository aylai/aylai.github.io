### currently
I am a researcher in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing working on AI/ML for social good and public policy issues with <a href="https://www.rayidghani.com/">Rayid Ghani</a> at CMU.

### previously
I worked on digital assistants for the medical domain as a Machine Learning Engineer at 3M, and on writing assistance tools for Word with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chrisq/">Chris Quirk</a> as an Applied Scientist at Microsoft. My work in industry has included collecting data to fine-tune large transformer models, applying knowledge distillation to produce fast and accurate models for production, and developing compact task-specific representations to improve model efficiency.

I graduated in 2018 with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by <a href="https://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/">Julia Hockenmaier</a>. My PhD research focused on how to tackle semantic tasks like textual entailment using image caption denotations. I also interned with <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~tetreaul/academic.html">Joel Tetreault</a> at Grammarly in 2017 and with the Amazon A9 Product Search group in 2016.
